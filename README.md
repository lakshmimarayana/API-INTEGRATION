#DESCRIPTION:
Developing a webpage that integrates with a public API to fetch and display data is a common and essential task in modern web development. This process involves using JavaScript to make requests to an external service (the API) and then dynamically updating your webpage with the received information.

Let's develop a webpage that fetches and displays news headlines from a public API. We'll use the News API, which is a popular choice for news data.

# Why News API?

Provides a wide range of news articles from various sources.

Offers different endpoints (e.g., top headlines, everything) for flexibility.

Requires an API key for authentication, which is typical for many public APIs.

# Prerequisites:

Web Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.

Text Editor: VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, etc.

A News API Key: You'll need to sign up for a free developer account on News API (https://newsapi.org/) to get an API key. This key authenticates your requests.

# Project Structure:
Create a new folder for your project, e.g., news_app. Inside this folder, create three files:

index.html (for the page structure)

style.css (for styling)

# How to Run:
Save all files: Ensure index.html, style.css, and script.js are in the same folder.

Get your API Key: Go to News API, sign up for a free developer account, and get your API key. Replace YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY in script.js with this key.

Open index.html: Double-click on index.html in your file explorer, or drag and drop it into your web browser.

You should see a webpage titled "Latest News Headlines" with various news articles displayed below it. Each article will show its title, a truncated description, and a "Read More" link to the original source.
